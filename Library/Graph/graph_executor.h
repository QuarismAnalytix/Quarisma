/**
 * @brief Runs a graph's nodes in parallel, respecting dependency order.
 *
 * The scheduler is an autograd-engine-style ready queue, not a per-node
 * future chain. At the start of a run each node gets an atomic
 * `remaining_deps` counter; when a node finishes it decrements each
 * successor's counter, and a successor that hits zero is pushed onto a
 * ready queue. Workers pop ready nodes and run them. This is the shape of
 * PyTorch's autograd engine (torch/csrc/autograd/engine.cpp), minus the
 * per-node shared_future overhead push_dependent would add -- scheduling a
 * node is one atomic decrement and (when it becomes ready) one push, not a
 * shared_future allocation.
 *
 * The ready queue is priority-ordered by each node's bottom-level
 * (critical-path) priority computed at build time, so nodes on a longer
 * chain to a sink are started before side branches on few threads.
 *
 * The worker pool is owned by the executor and reused across run() calls
 * -- constructing threads is the dominant fixed cost of running a small
 * graph, so it is paid once per executor, not once per run(). Actual
 * concurrency is controlled by graph_executor_options::number_of_threads.
 *
 * A node's work_ may throw. graph_executor catches it (instead of letting
 * it escape a worker thread, which would otherwise call std::terminate()),
 * records the first such failure, and skips every node that depends,
 * directly or transitively, on the failed node -- see run()'s status
 * return.
 *
 * Thread safety: a single graph_executor's run() must not be called
 * concurrently from multiple threads. Running two distinct executors, or
 * two distinct graphs on two executors, concurrently is fine.

     * (graph_builder::with_node_version / keyed_graph_builder::
     * with_key_version) differs from `baseline_versions[id]`, or when any

     *
     * `in_out_cache` is both input and output: on entry it must hold the
     * previous run's results (keyed by node_id; missing entries make their
     * node dirty); on return it holds this run's results for every node
     * (recomputed for dirty nodes, carried over for clean ones).
     *
     * `baseline_versions` is indexed by node_id and should hold the stamps
     * the cache was computed against; entries past the end of the vector
     * count as version 0 (so an empty baseline dirties every stamped node).
     * A node that is clean but missing from the cache is treated as dirty.
     *
     * Failure of a dirty node propagates to its dependents (they are
     * skipped, as in run()); clean nodes are unaffected. A failed/skipped
     * node's result is NOT written back into the cache, so the next run
     * recomputes it rather than serving an empty result.
     *
     * @warning The cache and baseline are keyed by node_id, so they are only
     * meaningful across runs of graphs whose node ids are stable -- i.e. the
     * same builder calls in the same order. Rebuilding a keyed graph after a
     * dependency change can permute resolution order and hence ids; callers
     * doing that must re-snapshot the baseline (and ideally the cache)
     * against the new graph's ids. Stamp versions starting at 1: version 0
     * means "unstamped" and never triggers a version-based recompute.
