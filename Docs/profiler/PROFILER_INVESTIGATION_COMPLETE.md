# Quarisma Profiler Investigation: Complete Summary

## Investigation Scope
✅ Analyzed `Library/Core/profiler/` (excluding `native/` subfolder)
✅ Identified existing components and their functionality
✅ Mapped dependencies and integration points
✅ Identified gaps preventing code instrumentation
✅ Specified missing components with implementation details

---

## Key Findings

### ✅ What Exists (Functional)
1. **RecordFunction** - Low-level callback system for profiling events
2. **profiler_session** - Session management with hierarchical scopes
3. **profiler_scope** - RAII-based scope profiling
4. **Observer/Orchestration** - Profiler state and configuration
5. **Backend Profilers** - Kineto, ITT, NVTX integrations
6. **Memory Tracking** - Memory statistics collection
7. **Statistical Analysis** - Timing statistics and percentiles
8. **Report Generation** - Multiple output formats

### ❌ What's Missing (Critical Gaps)

| Component | Purpose | Impact |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `profiler_event` | Event representation | Can't store captured events |
| `event_recorder` | Event collection | Events from callbacks are lost |
| `callback_helpers` | Callback registration | No integration between systems |
| `record_function_api` | High-level instrumentation | Users must use low-level API |
| Session integration | Connect session to callbacks | Profiler and callbacks independent |
| FunctionSchema impl | Capture metadata | Limited event information |

---

## The Core Problem

**RecordFunction** and **profiler_session** operate as **separate systems**:

```
RecordFunction System          profiler_session System
├─ Callbacks registered        ├─ Hierarchical scopes
├─ Events triggered            ├─ Memory tracking
├─ Observers notified          ├─ Statistical analysis
└─ Events LOST (no storage)    └─ Report generation
```

**Missing**: Bridge to connect these systems and capture events

## How to Instrument Code (Current vs. Desired)

### Current (Incomplete)
```cpp
// Option 1: Use low-level RecordFunction
quarisma::RecordFunction guard(quarisma::RecordScope::USER_SCOPE);
guard.before("my_function");
// ... code ...
guard.end();

// Option 2: Use macro (doesn't use RecordFunction)
{
    QUARISMA_PROFILE_SCOPE("my_operation");
    // ... code ...
}
```

### Desired (After Implementation)
```cpp
// Simple, high-level API
{
    auto event = quarisma::record_function("my_function");
    // ... code ...
    // Event automatically captured and stored
}

// Or with macro
{
    QUARISMA_RECORD_FUNCTION("my_operation");
    // ... code ...
}
```

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Event Infrastructure (Foundation)
- [ ] Create `profiler_event` struct
- [ ] Create `event_recorder` class
- [ ] Add thread-safe event storage

### Phase 2: Callback Integration (Bridge)
- [ ] Create `callback_helpers` functions
- [ ] Modify `profiler_session` to register callbacks
- [ ] Implement callback start/end handlers

### Phase 3: High-Level API (User Interface)
- [ ] Create `record_function_api.h`
- [ ] Implement `record_function()` function
- [ ] Create `record_function_scope` RAII class

### Phase 4: Metadata Support (Enhancement)
- [ ] Implement `FunctionSchema` class
- [ ] Implement `OperatorName` class
- [ ] Add argument/return type capture

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation (Quality)
- [ ] Unit tests for each component
- [ ] Integration tests with profiler_session
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Thread-safety verification

## Dependencies & Relationships

```
User Code
    ↓
record_function() [NEW]
    ↓
RecordFunction (existing)
    ↓
Callbacks [NEW: callback_helpers]
    ↓
event_recorder [NEW]
    ↓
profiler_session [MODIFY]
    ↓
Report Generation (existing)
```

---

## Success Criteria

✅ Users can call `record_function("name")` to instrument code
✅ Events are automatically captured and stored
✅ Events integrate with profiler_session timeline
✅ Reports include RecordFunction events
✅ Thread-safe event collection
✅ Minimal performance overhead
✅ 98% code coverage for new components
✅ All existing tests pass

---

## Conclusion

The Quarisma profiler has **strong backend infrastructure** but lacks the **C++ API layer** for practical code instrumentation. The investigation identified **7 missing components** and **2 files requiring modification** to bridge the gap between low-level callbacks and high-level profiling.

**Estimated Implementation Effort**: 2-3 weeks for full implementation with testing

**Priority**: HIGH - This is blocking practical profiler usage

**Next Steps**: Begin Phase 1 implementation (Event Infrastructure)
