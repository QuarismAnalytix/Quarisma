# Implementation Checklist - COMPLETED ✅

## Pre-Implementation Verification
- [x] Identified all files using `parallel_thread_local`
- [x] Confirmed only 1 active usage location (parallel_tools.h line 93)
- [x] Verified no iteration/aggregation patterns used
- [x] Confirmed no external dependencies
- [x] Analyzed 4 viable options
- [x] Selected Option 1 (Standard C++ `thread_local`)

## Code Changes

  - [x] Removed include: `#include "parallel_thread_local.h"`
  - [x] Updated documentation comments
  - [x] Removed member variable: `parallel_thread_local<unsigned char> initialized_;`
  - [x] Removed constructor initialization: `initialized_(0)`
  - [x] Updated `Execute()` method to use `thread_local unsigned char initialized = 0;`

## File Removal

- [x] Removed `Library/Core/parallel/std_thread/parallel_thread_local_backend.h`
- [x] Removed `Library/Core/parallel/std_thread/parallel_thread_local_backend.cpp`
- [x] Removed `Library/Core/parallel/openmp/parallel_thread_local_impl.h`
- [x] Removed `Library/Core/parallel/openmp/parallel_thread_local_backend.h`
- [x] Removed `Library/Core/parallel/openmp/parallel_thread_local_backend.cpp`
- [x] Removed `Library/Core/parallel/tbb/parallel_thread_local_impl.h`

## CMake Configuration
- [x] Verified `Library/Core/CMakeLists.txt` uses GLOB_RECURSE
- [x] Confirmed no manual file references needed removal

## Code Verification
- [x] Verified no remaining references to `parallel_thread_local` in source code
- [x] Verified all documentation comments updated
- [x] Verified code compiles without errors
- [x] Verified code compiles without warnings

## Build & Test

- [x] Created `Docs/IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST_COMPLETED.md`

## Post-Implementation Status
- [x] Code changes complete
- [x] Build successful
- [x] Tests passing
- [x] No regressions detected
- [x] Ready for code review
- [x] Ready for commit

## Summary

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE**

All implementation tasks completed successfully. The `parallel_thread_local` abstraction has been completely removed and replaced with standard C++ `thread_local`. All tests pass, no regressions detected, and the codebase is now simpler and more maintainable.
